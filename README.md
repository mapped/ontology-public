Mapped ontology used for modeling data in Mapped graphs

## Note
The DTDL is not 100% compliant with DTDL v3 as it relies on JSON-LD references. We are working with the DTDL community to add support for references in an upcoming release. If we are not successful, the DTDL will be updated to inline all definitions. This will make the file 100x bigger so let's hope we are successful :-)
